# Kessler Syndrome Board Game Card Analysis
Basic Card Analysis Program for the Kessler Syndrome Board Game

The purpose of this web site is to provide an interface for building decks of contract cards for the 
Kessler Syndrome Board Game. It will then be able to generate stats on those cards for analysis of balance
and variance. 

Current Status: WIP
Card and deck management is mostly complete, all that remains is the analysis component
